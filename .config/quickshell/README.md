**rebos_shell** is a Niri-first Wayland desktop shell built with
[Quickshell](https://quickshell.org).

## Hard fork

This project is a **hard fork** of
[Ambxst](https://github.com/Axenide/Ambxst) by
[Axenide](https://github.com/Axenide).

It is not Ambxst, does not track Ambxst as an upstream merge target for
day-to-day work, and ships under its own name, branding, config paths, and
release process. The fork keeps a lean runtime focus:

- wallpaper
- one unified bar
- floating run menu
- lockscreen
- reactive JSON configuration

Multi-monitor support uses Quickshell `Variants` on `Quickshell.screens`.

## Features

- Runs directly on [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) via its JSON event stream
- Normalized monitor, workspace, and window state for multi-monitor setups
- Unified bar with workspaces/taskbar, clock, system status, and systray
- Floating run menu and power menu
- Wallpaper picker and secure `WlSessionLock` session lock
- Isolated `rebos_shell` config, state, cache, data, and IPC paths

## Direct commands

The shell exposes lightweight commands through its IPC runner. For example,
`rebos_shell run wallpapers` opens the wallpaper picker on the focused monitor
and toggles it closed when invoked again. This can be bound from Niri with:

```kdl
Mod+Shift+W hotkey-overlay-title="Open Wallpapers" { spawn "rebos_shell" "run" "wallpapers"; }
```

## Run the development tree

Install Quickshell and the runtime tools needed by the shell. Install fonts once,
then run from a checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-fonts.sh
qs -p /path/to/rebos_shell
```

Or use the CLI wrapper:

```bash
./cli.sh
```

The installer and Nix package are still inherited scaffolding and may need
adjustment for this fork.
